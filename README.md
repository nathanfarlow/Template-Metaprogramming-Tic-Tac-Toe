# Template-Metaprogramming-Tic-Tac-Toe

A humorous solution for an assignment in CS 126 at the University of Illinois. This project evaluates the state of a tic tac toe board using only template metaprogramming. See src/tictactoe.cpp. This project took 20 minutes to compile on a quad core 3.0 GHz system and used ~65 gigabytes of memory. This project routinely crashes CLion.
